APSC169 Research Course Project

Developed a semi-autonomous treatment system combining existing membrane filtration systems and lime precipitation technologies to target heavy metals in low-pH abandoned mine effluent
Modelled contaminant behaviour, chemical dosing, and pH adjustment for a theoretical >96% removal efficiency in heavy metals; conducted economic analysis projecting $61M net present value over 5 years
